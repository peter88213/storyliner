# A stylesheet for viewing the storyliner project with a web browser

1. Copy *novx.css* into your project directory.
2. Open your *<project name>.stlx* file with your web browser.

**Note:** Depending on your web browser and your operating system, 
the *content type* resp. *MIME type* of *.stlx* files must be
registered as *"text/xml"*. Under Windows, yo can do this by
running the **<home>\.storyliner\add_storyliner.reg** script.
